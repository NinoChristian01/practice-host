      In the dance of life, where many paths unfold, There's one companion,
      <br />
      loyal and bold. With fur as soft as the morning's light, My dog, my<br />
      friend, my constant delight. His eyes, like pools of warm, brown earth,<br />
      Reflect a love of boundless worth. A wagging tail that speaks volumes<br />
      true, Of joy and comfort found in you. He greets each day with eager
      play<br />, A bounding spirit that chases away, The shadows of life, the
      stress, the<br />
      strife, Replacing them with laughter, with zest for life. In quiet<br />
      moments, by my side he lies, A gentle presence, a comforting sigh. His<br />
      steady breath, a lullaby so sweet, In his company, my heart finds its<br />
      beat. Through rain and storm, through sun and snow, He walks beside me,<br />
      wherever I go. A faithful guide, a steadfast friend, On whom I know I
      can<br />
      depend. He teaches me of love so pure, Of happiness in simple lore. To<br />
      find delight in little things, In chasing dreams and butterfly wings.
      So<br />
      here's to my dog, my friend so true, For every moment shared with you.
      In<br />
      your love, I find my home, My heart, my joy, in you alone.
